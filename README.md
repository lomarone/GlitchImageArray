# GlitchImageArray
## By Lauren Marone

### Software Design
This assignment includes the basics of p5 like variables, setup function, draw function, and drawing shapes, as well as some advanced concepts. I used state machines for each image and its interactions. There are 6 images that the user can choose by clicking its corresponding key. For each image, the user is able to interact with it using their mouse. I have interactions spanning from drawing on the screen to hovering for text to appear. 


### Reflections
This project caused a lot of stress for me. I have been having a rough week so I dont think I did my best work on this assignment, but I hope that I can redeem myself for the next assignment as well as project 1. At first, I tried to make the images appear randomly with time through an array and connect the state to each image, however, I could not figure it out in time. I could get the images to appear randomly but I was not able to link a specific state with an image.
